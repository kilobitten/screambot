Screambot just freaks out about everything all the time, on slack.

To set it up, install the slackclient module. On ubuntu that's:  

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`
`sudo pip install slackclient`


To run the tests, install python-pytest  
`sudo apt-get install python-pytest`

and run

`$ py.test test_screambot.py`
